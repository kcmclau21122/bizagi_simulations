provide a py method named "build_paths" that takes as input the attached output_sequences.txt file and returns a df for all the possible paths for a given process based on the linkages in the output_sequences.txt file.  Note that the path will start with the activity that has the "Type" equal to "[Type: Start]".  
Note that the "from" activity name is the substring that starts at the first character to in the row's string and ends at the character prior to the string "->".  Note that the "to" activity name is the substring that starts with the first character to the right of the "->" string and ends with the character prior to the "[" string.

To build a path, start with the first row then store the "from" activity as the first activity in the path.  

Next look for the next row's "from" activity that matches the "to" activity from the row the path started with.  

For example, if this is the first row's value "Monthly [Type: Start] -> Review AM using Asset Change Tracker (5.5.13.1) [Type: Activity Step]" then the path will start with the activity "Monthly [Type: Start]" and the next step in the path is to "to" in this row so that is "Review AM using Asset Change Tracker (5.5.13.1) [Type: Activity Step]".  

Now to find the third activity name in this path look for the first occurrence of a row that starts with the string "Review AM using Asset Change Tracker (5.5.13.1)" which is the activity name then select the "from" from this row and add it as the next activity in the path.  

In this example, the next row that meets this criteria is the second row who's value is "Review AM using Asset Change Tracker (5.5.13.1) -> Complete /Accurate? [Type: Activity Step]" so the third activity for this path is "Complete /Accurate? [Type: Activity Step]".  

Note that a "to" activity may have more than one match across the rows.  When this occurs then the path splits into one or more sub-paths that diverge when a "to" activity contains either "[Type: CONDITION", or "[Inclusive Gateway]".
Note, if the "to" contains the string "[Type: CONDITION" then the path will split into two or more sub-paths which are exclusive, the token can only take one of the sub-paths based
on the probabilty defined in the simulation_metrics.xlsx file.  When creatig these sub-paths set the probabilty to zero for each sub-path for this method.

Note, if the Note, if the "to" contains the string "[Inclusive Gateway]" then the path will split into two or more sub-paths which are inclusive, the token can take one or more of the sub-paths based
on the probabilty defined in the simulation_metrics.xlsx file.  When creatig these sub-paths set the probabilty to zero for each sub-path for this method.

Note, if the Note, if the "to" contains the string "[Parallel Gateway]" then the path will split into two or more sub-paths which are inclusive, the token will travel down all of the sub-paths.
There is no probability linked to type "[Parallel Gateway]" sub-path since the token travels down all of the sub-paths.

Continue to build the path until a type of "[Type: Stop]" is found and is added to the path or there are no additional activity name matches between a "from" activity name and a "to" activity name.
Note that each sub-path may also have a type of "[Type: Stop]" so need to build each sub-path until no more linkages are found or a type of "[Type: Stop]" is reached 
for the sub-path.  

Note, a path or sub-path may loop back to an activity in the path or another sub-path so be sure to not go into an endless loop when building the path and sub-paths.

For the attached output_sequences.txt file there are paths and sub-paths:
