Backlog:
    1. Create Paths - to include parallel Paths - Done
    2. Update simulatiomn logic to handle:
        a. Inclusive gateways
        b. parallel Paths
        c. Exclusive paths
        d. No gateway paths - Seems to work
    3. Fix issue with tracking completed tokens
    4. Method to diagram the simulation_log.txt to show the paths the tokens traveled. 
    5. Ability to use calendars to understand working time and non-working time
